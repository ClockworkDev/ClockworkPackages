# ClockworkPackages
All the Clockwork Packages available.

## Add or update a package
When you have a components file ready to be added, fork this repository in your computer and run the command <code>clockwork-tools publish</code> (from the Clockwork CLI Tools http://clockwork.js.org/documentation.html#cli) at the root folder. It will then ask you for the path to the source file of your new package, the name, and the version. Once done, the package will be added and you will need to create a pull request on Github.
